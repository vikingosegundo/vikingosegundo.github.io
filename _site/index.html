<h2><a href="/2015/12/23/solid-swift-dip/">SOLID Swift, Dependency Inversion Principle</a></h2>
<h4>23 December 2015</h4>
<p>This is he first article in a series about applying the SOLID principles in Swift,
mainly for the iOS and Mac platforms. I will not start with the <em>S</em>, but with the <em>D</em>
— The Dependency Inversion Principle, DIP</p>

<h2><a href="/2015/05/30/contract-based-development-in-swift/">Contract Based Development in Swift</a></h2>
<h4>30 May 2015</h4>
<p>Recently I started working an existing Swift project.</p>

<p>One task I was asked was to gain higher decoupling. The project had a high
coupling mainly through the excessive use of singletons — they were everywhere:</p>

<ul>
<li>Model layer: <code>User.current()</code></li>
<li>Networking: <code>APIManager.sharedManager()</code></li>
<li>extra methods in the AppDelegate</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="/2015/02/05/implement-comparator/">Implementing Comparator Sorting with QuickSort Algorithm</a></h2>
<h4>05 February 2015</h4>
<p>This shows how to implement a block based sorting with the quicksort algorithm.</p>

<p>in response to this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28348022/how-is-the-sortedarrayusingcomparator-method-implemented">Stackoverflow question</a></p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="objc">#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;
#import "NSArray+Comparator"

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        NSArray *array = @[@4, @9, @2, @1, @7];
        array = [array vs_sortedArrayUsingComparator:^NSComparisonResult(id obj1, id obj2)
        {
            return  [obj1 compare:obj2];
        }];
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Results in
<code>objc
( 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 )
</code></p>

<h2><a href="/2015/01/28/once-and-for-all/">Once and For All — Data Source Adapter Pattern</a></h2>
<h4>28 January 2015</h4>
<p>In iOS and Mac development a plague is spreading around the world.<br/>
Many view controller become so heavy and obese that we must expect our devices
to suffer from Type-II Diabetes. This disease is super-contangeous and it's
ground zero is well known: <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a></p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of this syndrome?</h3>

<p>Among others others they are the usual suspects when it come to obisity:</p>

<ul>
<li>hard to move</li>
<li>unflexibel</li>
<li>hard to breed</li>
<li>no sex appeal</li>
</ul>


<h3>Where and how did the current outbreak start?</h3>

<p>It is not known by now where the gems that transport this disease came to
existence, but once they reached <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a>, it broke loose.<br/>
Since than it is spreading through the main transport infrastructure like Apple's
sample codes, mailinglists, stackoverflow.com, Books,…</p>

<h2><a href="/2011/10/24/variadic-lists-and-blocks/">Variadic Lists and Blocks</a></h2>
<h4>24 October 2011</h4>
<p>Matt Gallagher <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/05/variable-argument-lists-in-cocoa.html">posted an great article about veriadic lists</a>. In his conclusion he writes</p>

<blockquote><p>In your own code, variadic methods should be used sparingly — passing variables in an NSArray or NSDictionary is safer (if slightly slower and syntactically more verbose) due to the fact that these classes do offer introspection.<br/>
And I think he is right.
But now I found a situation, where it makes much more sense to have a veridic list of arguments rather a NSArray or NSDictionary.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote a Category method on NSArray, that allows the user, to filter the array by blocks and create a dictionary with given keys.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">
- (NSDictionary *) dictionaryByFilteringWithBlocks:(NSArray *)filterBlocks
                                           forKeys:(NSArray *)keys
</code></pre>

<h2><a href="/2011/10/09/beat-this-python/">Beat This, Python!</a></h2>
<h4>09 October 2011</h4>
<p><strong>I love Python. I love Objective-C.</strong></p>

<p>"Huh?!" I hear you thinking, "they are complete different, how can you like both"?</p>

<p>Well, nothing is perfect, even in a lovely relationship.
There are things, that drive me crazy in one — and things that are missing, form my point of view, in the other language</p>

<p>One thing I'd love to see in Python, that Objective-C has, is extending a class — Categories.
Every language should have functional tools like pythons List Comprehensions, but Objective-C hasn't.</p>

<p>But since Apple extended Objective-C by introducing Blocks to the underlaying C, it is now possible to have something similar to List Comprehensions — and this article is about how.
When people ask me, why I am such a big fan of Python, I usually refer to a sample Quicksort algorithm using List Comprehensions.
here we go:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def quicksort(alist):
  if len(alist) &lt;= 1: return alist
    pivotelement = alist.pop()
    left  = [element for element in alist if element &lt; pivotelement]
    right = [element for element in alist if element &gt;= pivotelement]
  return quicksort(left) + [pivotelement] + quicksort(right)
</code></pre>
